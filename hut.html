<img src="hut.jpeg"alt="HUT">
<p>A hut is a small dwelling, which may be constructed of various local materials. Huts are a type of vernacular architecture because they are built of readily available materials such as wood, snow, stone, grass, palm leaves, branches, clay, hides, fabric, or mud using techniques passed down through the generations.</p>
